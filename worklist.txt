-create object for moving player to new areas/scenes


note: when adding new features/events to objects, i should create an object_behavior scene for this
can practice this with the new object im going to create for moving player to new areas/scenes
a scene_changer scene will need a few paramaters: what scene to change to, where to put player in the new scene

perhaps for the second paramater, i could create another object and point that to the scene_changer scene rather than inputting xyz coordinates into the scene changer

i could also potentially have scene changers link to eachother, and to allow one way transitions, i could simply remove one of the scene changers from being able to be interacted with
