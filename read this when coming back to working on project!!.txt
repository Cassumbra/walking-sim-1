need to set up packaging system for scenes and way of saving playe data

package player as scene when leaving a scene
put the player back in when entering scene
hold off on doing scene transition stuff, maybe try to create a title screen and load the first area from there? might be easier to do that and also it'll be good to have a break from annoying stuff


when we do get to transitioning from one area to another, we can use packaged scenes for saving area data
if there is no packaged scene for an area, then we'll just use the default scene
also need to add a button to the menu to delete all data
or a toggle-able thing to ignore saved data
or both!!!!

also need to add things that change in the world for data saving: simplest thing would be to have a cowboy movin and we can save his position
